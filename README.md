**Intake:**
  
Upon logging into the system, the Help Desk Agent/Admin is presented with a view displaying the available tickets. These tickets may be either assigned or unassigned and are accompanied by their respective priorities. The priority of a ticket can be set by the Help Desk Agent or the queue manager responsible for handling the tickets. The displayed information includes the `Ticket number`, `Last Updated` timestamp, `Subject`, the user who created the ticket `(From)`, priority level, and the individual or team to whom the ticket is assigned `(Assigned To)`.

<p>
  
**Working Issues:**
  
As we address the issue of the `"entire mobile online banking being down"`, which is considered a business impacting event, we will update the ticket's priority from the default **"Normal"** to **"Emergency"**. The following steps illustrate the process of changing the priority and updating the notes:

<p>
  
The ticket has undergone updates, including re-assignment to `Jane Doe` from the support team, who was previously unassigned. Additionally, the ticket has been transferred from the **Support Department** to the **System Administrators Department**.

The updated tickets, as shown in the previous image, indicate that they are assigned to `Jane Doe` and their priority has been changed to **Emergency**.

<p>
  
**Resolution:**
  
After contacting with the `System Admin` team, we have received a response confirming that the ticket has been resolved. The ticket now contains comments that reflect the details of this resolution.

As the ticket has been successfully resolved, it will now be moved to the **closed** tickets column to indicate its resolution.
