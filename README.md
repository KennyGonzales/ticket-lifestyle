**Intake:**
  
Upon logging into the system, the Help Desk Agent/Admin is presented with a view displaying the available tickets. These tickets may be either assigned or unassigned and are accompanied by their respective priorities. The priority of a ticket can be set by the Help Desk Agent or the queue manager responsible for handling the tickets. The displayed information includes the `Ticket number`, `Last Updated` timestamp, `Subject`, the user who created the ticket `(From)`, priority level, and the individual or team to whom the ticket is assigned `(Assigned To)`.
